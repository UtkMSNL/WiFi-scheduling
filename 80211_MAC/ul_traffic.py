# Projectname: uwicore@umh_80211_MAC

# Filename: ul_traffic.py

# This script, developed by the Uwicore Laboratory at the University Miguel Hernandez of Elche, 
# simulates the arrival of different packets to transmit from the upper layers. The payload is 
# a plain ASCII string, but in future versions might be a packet from OSI upper layers, such as
# IP, TCP or UDP. More detailed information can be found at www.uwicore.umh.es/mhop-testbeds.html 
# or at the publication:
